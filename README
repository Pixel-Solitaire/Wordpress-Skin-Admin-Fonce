"Skin Admin Classic Foncé" is a real basic skin for the 
Wordpress administrative section. It was developped to

modification to the look of these pages like plugins 
creation or more complex admin customizations.

2. Upload the folder (and its content...) you just
   extracted to your "wp-content/plugins/" directory.
3. Log to your admin, go to the plugin panel and
   activate "Pixel Solitaire - Skin Admin Classic Foncé".

============ To Do : ===========

  (footer notes function) 
3. Re-ordering the CSS rules in a more
   efficient/logical way
4. Adding a settings page with options?
